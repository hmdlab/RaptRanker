# sqlite-amalgamation
- [Release History](https://www.sqlite.org/changes.html)
- [Chronology](https://www.sqlite.org/chronology.html)

This repository mirrors the [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
amalgamation, which is the recommended method of building SQLite into larger
projects.
It also supports `cmake` for building, installing and exporting.

SQLite includes more than 100 files in `*.c` / `*.h`, but
> The [amalgamation](http://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html) contains
> everything you need to integrate SQLite into a larger project. Just copy the
> amalgamation into your source directory and compile it along with the other C
> code files in your project.
> ([A more detailed discussion](http://www.sqlite.org/howtocompile.html) of the
> compilation process is available.) You may also want to make use of
> the "sqlite3.h" header file that defines the programming API for SQLite. The
> sqlite3.h header file is available separately. The sqlite3.h file is also
> contained within the amalgamation, in the first few thousand lines. So if you
> have a copy of sqlite3.c but cannot seem to locate sqlite3.h, you can always
> regenerate the sqlite3.h by copying and pasting from the amalgamation.

## build / install
A static lib (`libsqlite3`) and the sqlite3 shell will be generated by the build
system.

```bash
$> mkdir .build
$> cd .build
$> cmake /path/to/this/repo  # or cmake .. -G Ninja
$> ccmake .                  # for build options or cmake-gui .
$> make -j 2                 # or ninja

$> make install
```

## usage
to integrate this library into your project simply add these lines to your
`cmake`:
```cmake
find_package(Sqlite3)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} sqlite3::sqlite3)
```

the include directory and link library will be automatically added to your target.


## SQLite3 build options
`SQLite` comes with plenty of compile options:

- `BUILD_ENABLE_DBSTAT_VTAB`
- `BUILD_ENABLE_FTS3`
- `BUILD_ENABLE_FTS5`
- `BUILD_ENABLE_ICU`
- `BUILD_ENABLE_JSON1` (enabled by default)
- `BUILD_ENABLE_RBU`
- `BUILD_ENABLE_RTREE`

the sqlite3 shell (executable) is disabled by default, to build it just
activate the `BUILD_SHELL` option.

for more information please have a look at [Compilation Options For
SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html)
